# LivingSystem: An Evolving Artificial General Intelligence

LivingSystem is an experimental implementation of an Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) designed to mimic a "living organism." It combines advanced neural network architectures with autonomous learning, self-evolution, and interaction with the external world. This project aims to explore the boundaries of AI adaptability and growth.

## Features

- **Multimodality**: Processes text and images using BERT and CLIP models.
- **Autonomous Learning**: Continuously learns from stimuli via reinforcement and meta-learning.
- **Self-Evolution**: Dynamically evolves its architecture and code using genetic algorithms and code modification.
- **Emotional Motivation**: Makes decisions based on simulated emotions (curiosity, satisfaction, fear, joy, anger).
- **World Interaction**: Integrates with the web (Google Search), news (NewsAPI), and simulated physical environments (OpenAI Gym).
- **Social Behavior**: Shares and receives knowledge with other instances via asynchronous sockets.
- **Resource Management**: Compresses its model and prunes memory to optimize resource usage.
